            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>It was around April 2024 that I first came across cloud computing and that is where interest quickly stirred me into action to explore this fast-growing sector. Since then, I have delved into the ever expanding universe of cloud technologies and learned important lessons about the core principles, growing services offerings, and best practices that are defining digital innovation for years to come.</p>

            <h2>What I Have Learnt</h2>
            
            <h3>Cloud Computing Fundamentals</h3>
            <p>My journey began with understanding the core concepts of cloud computing. I explored:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Service Models:</strong> Differentiating between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.</li>
                <li><strong>Deployment Models:</strong> Examining public, private, hybrid, and community clouds.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>AWS Cloud</h3>
            <p>Diving into Amazon Web Services (AWS) provided a robust foundation. Key takeaways include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>AWS Global Infrastructure:</strong> Understanding how regions and availability zones enhance performance and reliability.</li>
                <li><strong>Key Services:</strong> Familiarity with EC2, S3, RDS, and more, understanding their roles in application deployment.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Google Cloud Platform</h3>
            <p>Exploring Google Cloud Platform (GCP) introduced me to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Compute and Storage:</strong> Deploying applications using Compute Engine and managing data with Cloud Storage and BigQuery.</li>
                <li><strong>Networking:</strong> Configuring Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and leveraging load balancers for enhanced performance.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Skills Acquired</h2>
            <p>During my course of study, I have learned many skills, which include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Deploying simple web apps:</strong> I now have the ability to deploy simple web applications using cloud services, ensuring they are accessible and scalable through effective environment configuration and resource management.</li>
                <li><strong>Setting Up Databases:</strong> I am skilled in setting up and managing cloud databases, enabling efficient data storage and retrieval for my applications. This includes utilizing services like Amazon RDS and Google Cloud SQL.</li>
                <li><strong>Creating CI/CD Pipelines:</strong> I have developed the skills to create continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines using tools like AWS CodePipeline and Google Cloud Build. This allows for automated testing and deployment, significantly improving development efficiency.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Future Aspirations</h2>
            <p>As I continue my learning journey, I aspire to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Attain professional certifications in AWS and GCP.</li>
                <li>Combine my data communication network skills with my cloud computing expertise for enhanced solutions.</li>
                <li>Explore advanced topics like machine learning and AI on cloud platforms.</li>
                <li>Contribute to open-source projects to apply my skills in real-world scenarios.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <p>As I conclude, cloud computing is more than just a trend; it represents the future of technology. I am excited to be part of this evolving landscape and look forward to leveraging my skills to create innovative solutions.</p>
